# BattleShip Game

The project is divided in three modules:

* Retrive input information on the board size and compute the correspoding boats to be placed.

* Players place the boats on the board. Game is initialized.

* Each player inputs a set of coordinates. If the coordinates match the position of an enemy's boat the player is informed that it "hit". If there is no boat in that position the player "missed".

* The game ends when one of the players lost all of their boats.

To compile: Write "make" in shell 
To execute: Write "make exec" after compilling.
To remove the files created by executing the program write "make clean" in the shell.
